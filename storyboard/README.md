## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Titration.

### 1. Story Outline:

The basic idea of this experiment is to let the student visually observe the complete redox titration method of how we calculate the strength of unknown potassium permanganate solution by using standard oxalic acid solution. This experiment will consist of vertical glass apparatus like burette, pipette, conical flask, test tube, beaker with the ability of a carrying out titration process using three chemical oxalic acid, dil. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. 
### 2. Story:

The strength of KMnO<sub>4</sub> is determined by doing titration against standard oxalic acid solution in acidic medium. The reaction is carried out at 60-70<sup>o</sup>C. first we rinse the burette with permanganate solution and fill it with the same solution. Adjust the level of solution to mark on the scale whwer you can read it conveniently then pipette out 10ml oxalic acid solution in conical flask. Add half a test tube (about 10ml) of dil. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to the oxalic acid solution. Shake and mix. Warm the mixture to 60-70<sup>o</sup>C then titrate against KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. Find the titrate value. The end point reach when it acquires pink colour which remains steady after mixing. Record the final reading of the burette.

## (1) canvas 1:
Start button shows on the canvas with experiment aim.
## (2) canvas 2:
First student will read the statements and choose the correct option. 
## (3) canvas 3:
Shows the setup of glass apparatus consist of pipette, conical flask, beaker, test tube. Student will start the titration on clicking the pipette then student will click on test tube to fill the conical flask by oxalic acid and sulphuric acid respectively.4
## (4) canvas 4 :
 Shows the burette with funnel and beaker containing KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. Student will click on the beaker to fill the burette by  KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. 
## (5) canvas 5:
Shows the fill in the blanks statement with boxes. Student will drag and drop the options in clicking the boxes.
## (6) canvas 6:
Shows four colour option on canvas with statement. Student will choose the correct colour for end point observation.
## (7) canvas 7:
Showing bureete with stand above the conical flask on the left and two buttons<br>(1) Start adding  KMnO<sub>4</sub> <br>(2) stop adding  KMnO<sub>4</sub> on the other side. Student start the titration by clicking the "start add" button and after completion click the "stop add" button to find the value of  KMnO<sub>4</sub> used.
