## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Titration.

### 1. Story Outline:

The basic idea of this experiment is to let the student visually observe the complete redox titration method of how we calculate the strength of unknown potassium permanganate solution by using standard oxalic acid solution. This experiment will consist of vertical glass apparatus like burette, pipette, conical flask, test tube, beaker with the ability of a carrying out titration process using three chemical oxalic acid, dil. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. 
### 2. Story:

The strength of KMnO<sub>4</sub> is determined by doing titration against standard oxalic acid solution in acidic medium. The reaction is carried out at 60-70<sup>o</sup>C. first we rinse the burette with permanganate solution and fill it with the same solution. Adjust the level of solution to mark on the scale whwer you can read it conveniently then pipette out 10ml oxalic acid solution in conical flask. Add half a test tube (about 10ml) of dil. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to the oxalic acid solution. Shake and mix. Warm the mixture to 60-70<sup>o</sup>C then titrate against KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. Find the titrate value. The end point reach when it acquires pink colour which remains steady after mixing. Record the final reading of the burette.   

## 2.1 Set the visual Stage Description:

## canvas 1:
Start button shows on the canvas with experiment aim.
## canvas 2:
First student will read the statements and choose the correct option. 
## canvas 3:
Shows the setup of glass apparatus consist of pipette, conical flask, beaker, test tube. Student will start the titration on clicking the pipette then student will click on test tube to fill the conical flask by oxalic acid and sulphuric acid respectively.4
## canvas 4 :
 Shows the burette with funnel and beaker containing KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. Student will click on the beaker to fill the burette by  KMnO<sub>4</sub> solutions. 
## canvas 5:
Shows the fill in the blanks statement with boxes. Student will drag and drop the options in clicking the boxes.
## canvas 6:
Shows four colour option on canvas with statement. Student will choose the correct colour for end point observation.
## canvas 7:
Showing bureete with stand above the conical flask on the left and two buttons<br>(1) Start adding  KMnO<sub>4</sub> <br>(2) stop adding  KMnO<sub>4</sub> on the other side. Student start the titration by clicking the "start add" button and after completion click the "stop add" button to find the value of  KMnO<sub>4</sub> used.   
## canvas 8:
Display the reaction with statements and student will click on the correct choice.
## canvas 9:
Incomplete redox reaction will appear on the canvas which is completed by student.
## canvas 10:
Shows the normality calculating formula. Appropriate data will be filled by the user for calculating the normality of unknown KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution and also shows the calculate button for calculating the normality if the answer is incorrect a hint will be shown on the canvas.
## canvas 11:
Shows the strength formula & click on the button for strength calculation. Student enter the value of equivalent weight then click on the button.

## 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Determine the strength of potassium permangnate solution in gram/Litre.

## 2.3 Set the pathway Activities:
Pathway activities for student  would be as follows.
**Step-1 :** Student will click on the start button. 

## 2.4 Set Chalengages and Questions/Complexity/variation in Questions:

## 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
In step 14 mentioned in the simulator instructions we use pitfalls.
In this step if the normality of KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution is not upto the mark than pitfall to rectify the calculation mistake in the experiment. In this situation hint will be given in the form of promt. If the user again do the mistake then  user will repeat the experiment. But if user fill the incorrect value of N2,v2 user goto the previous step for filling the correct data.

## 2.6 Conclusions: 
The student based on the performance of the summative assessment can help to ascertain the understanding of the student as question are based on learning outcomes. One or two question are based on aech learning outcome will summerize their performence in each LO and a combined evolution will help understand the overall performance of the experiment and they need to be taken again.
