## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Titration.

### 1. Story Outline:

To determine the strength of potassium permanganate by titrating it against the standard solution of 0.1M oxalic acid.

The titration of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) against oxalic acid (C2H2O4) is an example of a redox titration. In close proximity to the end point, the action of the indicator is analogous to the other types of visual color titrations in oxidation-reduction (redox) titrations.
### 2. Story:

Potassium permanganate is a strong oxidising agent and in the presence of sulfuric acid it acts as a powerful oxidising agent. In acidic medium the oxidising ability of KMnO4 is represented by the following equation.

In acidic solution,

MnO4– + 8H+ + 5e– → Mn2+ + 4H2O

Solution containing MnO4– ions are purple in colour and the solution containing Mn2+ ions are colourless and hence permanganate solution is decolourised when added to a solution of a reducing agent. The moment there is an excess of potassium permanganate present the solution becomes purple. Thus KMnO4 serves as self indicator in acidic solution.

Potassium permanganate is standardized against pure oxalic acid. It involves redox reaction. Oxalic acid is oxidised to carbon dioxide by KMnO4 which itself gets reduced to MnSO4. Oxalic acid reacts with potassium permanganate in the following way.


Overall Ionic reaction:- 2MnO4– + 16H+ + 5C2H42- → 2Mn2+ + 10CO2 + 8H2O

This titration cannot be carried out in the presence of acids like nitric acid or hydrochloric acid because itself is an oxidising agent. So hydrochloric acid chemically reacts with KMnO4 solution forming chlorine which is also an oxidising agent.

### 6. Formulas and equations used :
To calculate the strength of given KMnO4 in terms of molarity the following formula is used

a1M1V1 = a2M2V2

Where a1 and a2 are stoichiometric coefficient of oxalic acid and KMnO4 in a balanced chemical equation.

a1 = 2

a2 = 5

Where

M2 and M1 are molarities of potassium permanganate and oxalic acid solutions used in the titration.

V2 and V1 are the volume of potassium permanganate and oxalic acid solutions used in the titration.

Therefore,

KMnO4 = Oxalic acid

5M2V2 = 2M1V1

M2 = (2M1V1/5M2V2)

The strength of KMnO4 is calculated by using the molarity.

Strength = Molarity x Molar mass

2KMnO4 + 3H2SO4 ----------> K2SO4 + 2MnSO4 + 3H2O + 5[O]
